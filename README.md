Gregorian Calendar (Miladi):The Gregorian calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, is a solar calendar widely used today. It has 365 days in a common year and 366 days in a leap year. Leap years occur every 4 years, except for years divisible by 100, unless they are also divisible by 400. For instance, 2000 was a leap year because it's divisible by 400, but 1900 wasn't, as it's divisible by 100 but not 400.
Persian Calendar (Shamsi or Jalali):The Persian calendar is a solar calendar used in Iran and Afghanistan. It's also known as the Jalali calendar, developed by astronomers under the supervision of Omar Khayyam in the 11th century. It has 365 or 366 days in a year, consisting of 12 months. Leap years occur in a 33-year cycle and have an extra day.
